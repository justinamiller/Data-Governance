# Intelligent Data
* **Data Insight**: Access insights to support decision making forecasting and process automation.

* **Data Platform Engineering**: Ability to design and build data platforms, collect, stream and manage enterprise-wide data.
* **Machine Learning**: Leverage machine learning to take autonomous actions from data insights.

# Goals

* Make consistent, confident business decisions based on trustworthy data aligned with all the various purposes for the use of the data assets within the enterprise
* Meet regulatory requirements and avoid fines by documenting the lineage of the data assets and the access controls related to the data
* Improve data security by establishing data ownership and related responsibilities
* Define and verify data distribution policies including the roles and accountabilities of involved internal and external entities

* Plan better by not having to cleanse and structure data for each planning purpose
* Eliminate re-work by having data assets that is trusted, standardized and capable of serving multiple purposes
* Optimize staff effectiveness by providing data assets that meet the desired data quality thresholds

# Framework
A data governance framework is a set of data rules, organizational role delegations and processes aimed at bringing everyone on the organization on the same page.

There are many data governance frameworks out there. As an example, here is one from the [data governance institute](http://www.datagovernance.com/the-dgi-framework/).
